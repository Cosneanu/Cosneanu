Hi, I’m @Cosneanu, a future business analyst passionate about using data to solve problems and a media content creator for a local basketball team. 

I’m interested in analyzing all aspects of a company and finding non-ordinary solutions to problems, love learning new skills in many fields related to data. I’m currently learning data analysis technical skills and soft skills. I’m also continuing my journey in SQL, Power BI, and other programs for data.

I’m looking to collaborate on projects that improve company workflows. I’m also interested in contributing to open-source projects and sharing my knowledge with others.
